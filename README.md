# Prompt Sharing Framework (PSF) v2

Hey there. Let me start by saying I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

My brain contains a hazy dream. Let me give you a glimpse of it via a brainstorm list:

Wow, it would be so awesome if we developed a framework that:

- makes it easy to share and discover prompts for generative AI models
- prompt elements can be organized by category, industry, and use case
- We want an intuitive way for end users to browse, filter, and copy prompts (simple React front end?)
- We could link to the GitHub API to allow for programmatic access to the prompt library
- We could parameterize the prompts to make them more modular
- We could also sic the microservices architecture on this problem: decompose a prompt in four parts: Goal, Context, Expectations, and Source

If you want to collaborate on this project, post to this repo's Discussions and let's chat! Thanks, Tim












The mission of PSF is to become the global standard for sharing, discovering, and utilizing prompts for generative AI models.

## Key Features

*   **Centralized Prompt Repository:** A well-organized, searchable storehouse of prompts across various industries and use cases.
*   **Intuitive web interface (perhaps React.js?):** Browse, filter, and copy prompts with ease.
*   **Robust API (Node.js):** Programmatic access for integration into your own AI-powered applications.
*   **User contributions:** Community-driven expansion of the prompt library.
*   **Secure Azure Hosting:** Reliable and scalable infrastructure for worldwide access.

## Technical Overview

*   **Frontend:** React.js for a dynamic user experience.
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js to power the REST API.
*   **Database:** (Suggest a database based on your project scale, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
*   **Azure deployment:** (Suggest appropriate Azure services - App Service, Azure Functions, Container Instances, etc.)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to grow PSF's prompt library! Here's how:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Add new prompts or modify existing ones within the relevant industry folders.**
3.  **Submit a pull request.**

## Roadmap

*   **Enhanced Search:** Implement advanced search using keywords, tags, and natural language.
*   **Prompt Ratings and Reviews:** Allow users to rate the effectiveness of prompts.
*   **Personalization:** User profiles to save favorite prompts and custom collections.
